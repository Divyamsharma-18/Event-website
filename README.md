Welcome to my very first website project!  
Built during the early days of my web dev journey, this site may not be perfect — it’s not fully responsive, and you might spot a few rookie mistakes — but it holds a special place in my heart. 💖

## 🌼 About the Project

This was my beginner project focused on building a simple event/flower-themed website using basic HTML, CSS, and JS.  
It was never about perfection, but all about *starting*. From this, I learned a lot and have grown tremendously since then.
